    <p>
      At 21 weeks of pregnancy, I was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect called <a href="http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=transposition-of-the-great-arteries-tga-90-P01823" target="_blank">Transposition of The Great Arteries (TGA)</a>. It
      means that the artery that is supposed to connect to the left side of my heart is connected to the right side of
      my heart and vice versa. My two arteries are swapped. Because of that, the blood from my body doesn't go to the
      lungs and the blood from the lungs does not go to my body.
    </p>
    <p>
      My cardiologist, Dr. Marx at Boston Children's Hospital, said that this heart defect only happens to 1 in every 
      10,000 babies. It's not very common but Dr. Marx treats patients with this heart defect every day. I feel so lucky 
      to have him as my doctor.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixing this heart defect requires heart surgery which is called the "<a href="https://www.chw.org/medical-care/herma-heart/for-medical-professionals/pediatric-heart-surgery/arterial-switch-procedure" target="_blank">arterial switch</a>". What they do is basically
      swapping the two arteries back so that I can have a perfect blood circulation. The surgery is expected to happen
      within my first week of life at Boston Children's Hospital. After the surgery, I will be placed in the NICU for
      about a week or two. I can't wait to go home soon so please pray for me!

      Alhamdulillah, despite my unfortunate condition, I am blessed in so many ways. I am very lucky to be able to 
      figure out about my heart defect during the early stages of mommy's pregnancy. I also feel very fortunate because 
      among all the heart defect that exist in this world, I was given the one that is fixable. Not only it is fixable,
      babies with TGA tend to have a normal healthy life down the road insyaAllah. Furthermore, I am blessed to be able 
      to be born in a place where they have the best hospitals and doctors, not only in the United States, but the whole 
      world. And above all, I am so blessed to have my loving family (parents, grandparents, uncles, aunties etc.) who
      will always be there to support me all the way.
