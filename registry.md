        Hi Aunties & Uncles, here are my baby registries! For those of you who are not familiar with a Baby Registry, 
        it is a list of items that I would need. Click on any of the links below and you will see a list of items, some 
        of them have been purchased by someone (thanks!), some haven't. If you decide to buy for me an item on the list 
        as a gift, it will be shipped directly to my parent's apartment. My family will know who bought it (so we can 
        thank you). Baby Registry is part of the culture in the United States when babies like me are born. It's an 
        interesting way to avoid duplicate gifts, which might end up not being used.<br />
        Don't forget to leave a post on <a href="{{ site.url }}/wall">my baby wall.</a>
