    <p>
      It was on a Wednesday February 7th, 2018, mummy and daddy went to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC)
      to scan me. They already came last 2 weeks to do a full scan but the Doctor said that there were 2 images of
      my heart that they were not able to see.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "The baby is in the worst position for us to scan the heart. We would need you to come in the next 2 weeks to do 
      a follow up scan. Not being able to see those 2 images does not mean that there is something wrong. It just means 
      that we can't say that there's not anything that is not wrong. That's a double negative.", said the doctor.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      So, mummy and daddy thought that this time the scan would be a brief one as they already did a full scan on the 
      previous visit. They thought that it would be a normal doctor's visit day where they would go see the doctor
      and then daddy would send mummy back home before going to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour have passed by, but there's no sign of the practitioner will be done within the next few minutes.
      Mummy is feeling sleepy. Daddy is too. They both slept a bit late last night. After about 45 minutes, the
      practitioner stopped scanning and told us to stay put. "Why would scanning 2 images of the heart would take
      as long as a full body scan?", daddy was thinking in his head. They sat for about 7 minutes and then came in a
      female doctor. She introduced herself as Dr. Young and she told us that she was gonna take a couple of more
      images. And she did. After about 10 minutes, she asked mummy and daddy to wait while she analyzes the scanned
      images. And so we waited...
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Young came in to the scan room again but this time with a very concerned look. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "After looking at the images, we have a suspicion that your baby has a heart defect which is what we call
      <strong>Transposition of The Great Arteries</strong> or transposition for short. It means that the artery that is supposed to
      connect to the left side of the heart is connected to the right side and vice versa.", said Dr. Young.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mummy and daddy didn't know how to react at first as it was a very shocking news. It was a bit difficult to digest
      those words that came out of the doctor's mouth. A part of daddy felt like it was a dream. Trying to slowly sink
      into reality. Is this really happening to mummy and daddy's first baby? My cousins (mummy and daddy's niece and
      nephews) are all normal and healthy. And there's no history of heart problems in both mummy's side and daddy's
      side. Those were the thoughts that were going through mummy and daddy's mind. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Fortunately, it is repairable, but it requires surgery during the baby's first week of life.", explained Dr.
      Young.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Hearing that, mummy started bursting into tears. Daddy held her hand and hugged her to try to comfort her. Both of
      them were in disbelief. Dr. Young continues to explain that babies who undergo this surgery for this type of heart
      defect, the outcome is excellent. She repeated that sentece a couple of times to ensure that we fully understand
      it. Mummy kept crying. It was tough to hear that her first baby is having a heart problem and would need to go 
      for surgery after birth. Dr. Young gave mummy and daddy a few moments to sink it in and to pull themselves together
      again. She said that mummy and daddy would be talking to a genetic consultant in a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mummy and daddy was waiting in a small room for the consultant. Mummy was still crying. By this time, there were
      a thousand questions in daddy's mind. How is this gonna affect the baby's growth? Is our baby gonna be okay?
      Will mummy be able to deliver as normal? A few minutes later, Dr. Rachel (the consultant) came in to the room. 
      She said her condolences to mummy and daddy for the unfortunate news. She explained again what transposition is
      and tried to convince mummy and daddy that even though this is bad news, it is one of the most fortunate heart
      defect that a baby can have because it is fixable and the baby will have a normal healthy life after surgery.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Rachel asked mummy and daddy a couple of questions related to family medical history. She wanted to see if
      there is anything out of the ordinary that might cause this to happen. After listening to all of mummy and
      daddy's answers, she was pretty confident that there are no correlations between the family's medical history
      with the baby's condition. Dr. Rachel then suggested that mummy and daddy to do an amniocentesis which is a
      procedure of getting a sample of the amniotic fluid in mummy's tummy to do genetic tests. This is just to ensure
      that there are no other defects/problems that I might have. Mummy and daddy discussed about it as although the
      procedure would give more information, there's also a 1 in 1000 risk of misscariage. Mummy and daddy decided to
      proceed with the procedure and they signed the consent form.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Mummy and daddy were directed to another scan room at the end of the hallway. The practitioner who scanned mummy
      earlier helped to do the preparation for the procedure. A couple of minutes later, Dr. Young came in with another
      female doctor, Dr. Donna. She will be assisting Dr. Young throughout the procedure. After a couple minutes of 
      setup, Dr. Donna spread some gooey fluid on mummy's tummy. It was brown in color, and the texture was a little bit
      different than the usual fluid that they usually use for ultrasound. Dr. Young asked mummy to put both her hands
      on top of her head and asked daddy to come closer to hold mummy's hand. Dr. Young scanned mummy's tummy to try to
      decide where to get the fluid. After getting a mutual decision with Dr. Donna, Dr. Donna poked mummy's tummy on
      the left side with a needle. Mummy and daddy was able to see the needle going into the amniotic sack from the
      monitor. Dr. Donna quickly extracted three tubes of amniotic fluid. The whole process took about 2-3 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Rachel was able to get us an appointment with the Boston Childrens Hospital's cardio departmentat 2pm on the
      same day.
